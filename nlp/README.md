# Coding Outreach Group Summer Workshop
# Natural Language Processing: Semantic Flow
07/20/2022

__**Content creator:**__ Celia Litovsky

## Description
In this workshop, we will discuss one of many natural language processing techniques, in which we compute the flow of semantic information in text. We will cover some theory on semantic cognition, an overview of capturing semantic information using vectors, and learn how to utilize the new semdistflow R package, which computes the flow of semantic information in text.

## Prerequisites
1. Basic comfort coding in R
2. Familiarity with basic linear algebra (matrices, vectors, cosine similarity)

## Set Up (do before the workshop)
1. Make sure you have the most up-to-date R and RStudio installed
    - Download R [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/)
    - Download RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
2. Make sure you have the semdistflow package installed
    - Instructions for how to install the semdistflow package can be found [here](https://github.com/Reilly-ConceptsCognitionLab/semdistflow)
3. Make sure you have these R packages installed, which are required for the analyses in Tutorial 2
    - dplyr
    - table1
    - ggplot2
    - tidyr
    - cocor
    - lme4
    - lmerTest
    - optimx
    - stringr
    - viridis
    - purrr
    - here
4. Download the included text files for use in Tutorial 2
    
## Workshop objectives:
1. Introduce semantics as vector representations
2. Demonstrate how to use the semdistflow R package to compute flow of semantic information in text
3. Demonstrate uses of semantic flow in semantic analysis
