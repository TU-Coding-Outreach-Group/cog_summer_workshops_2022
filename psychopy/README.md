## Description
This workshop will cover key components of working with the PsychoPy using the 'coder' IDE. PsychoPy is a free, open-source software package for experimental design. For people without coding experience, [past](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2020/tree/master/psychopy) [workshops](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2021/tree/main/psychopy) from COG have covered how to use the PsychoPy Builder GUI. In this workshop, we will cover various components of designing experimental tasks using the 'coder' IDE with specific emphasis on tools that are useful for neuroimaging experiments. 

## Prerequisites
1. Comfort coding in python.
2. Familiarity with experimental design (randomization, trial-based experiments, etc.).

## Set Up (do before the workshop)
1. Install standalone [PsychoPy](https://psychopy.org/download.html) (version 22.1.3 or later).
2. Download the 'stim' folder and materials [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Au0SkjkGT_t3kILqU3KMbY3K3L7tZF2Z?usp=sharing). These can also be downloaded from the TU COG Github. This folder will contain the necessary files for the exercises in today's workshop.
3. Download the 'adorable_study.py' script from Github.

    
## Workshop objectives:
1. Introduce key components of the 'coder' portion of Python.
2. Review experimental design tools that are particularly helpful for neuroimaging tasks.
