    "GitHub is a collaborative platform for individuals who code. The nice thing about GitHub is that you can host many different types of code and script here to share with others! It also makes it easy to upload files in a convient place for both your own work and those that colaborate with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of GitHub as one big directory hosted online. You are in charge of the directory under the user name you create, while also being able to share directories with labmates or collaborators, and you can contribute to others' directories. Directories (aka repos) can hold data, scripts, and even full programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing you need to know about GitHub for this workshop is how to copy projects to your local computer, make a change to the directory, and send that change back to the website. Before you start creating your own project, we are going to have you download one of our pages, upload an image of your own, and then upload it back into our project on GitHub."

    "### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Some definitions on terms that are used frequently before we get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repository (Repo)**: a project folder on GitHub. You can think of it as the \"main base\" for a project, the folder where everything is stored. All of your changes need to be inside of this folder, and this is the folder that you will send back to GitHub when you have made all of the necessary changes. Can also be referred to as the **remote** once it has been downloaded to your local machine, as remote contains the actual URL from GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branch**: this refers to the fact that there can be different versions of one project. The default for your main project branch is literally called _main_. (Please note that the default used to be called master - if you are looking at older documentation and they refer to the master branch, they are just talking about the default branch of your repo). You can make many branches to a project; this can be used to work with experimental changes to your project, creating a new version of your project (or preserving the old one), etc. We will be working in an old branch of my website repository so you all can build your websites from a more basic template.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fork**: This is an action in which you create a copy of a repository. This is helpful in collaborative settings where you want someone to make changes to your project without directly editing things. They can fork your repository, make the changes that they want, and then you have the option of adding those changes from the fork to your repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Clone**: This is the action of copying a repository to your local machine. This also opens an online connection between your computer and GitHub that allows you to check the differences betweem them. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Origin**: This refers to the primary version of your repository. You can have a few different versions of your repo, but you are required to indicate which one is the default. It also refers to the GitHub URL of the repo you are currently working in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Front Matter**: this is the information at the top of a Markdown file that gives information to GitHub about where it should be in relation to other pages, what the title should be, etc."
