## Description
Qualtrics offers out-of-the box survey capabilities and is paid for by the University. Itâ€™s easier to get survey data from online panels (MTurk, Prolific, Cloud Research) with software such as Qualtrics or Pavlovia instead of recruiting in-person.

Today, we are going to build a few workflows using Qualtrics and see how javascript can be used to customize options beyond vanilla Qualtrics.

## Prerequisites
1. Have a working Qualtrics account.

## Set Up (do before the workshop)
1. Download the images from the [stim folder](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2022/tree/main/javascript-qualtrics/stim).
2. Download the sample surveys from the [qsfs folder](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2022/tree/main/javascript-qualtrics/qsfs) and import them into Qualtrics. [Click here for instructions on how to import ths surveys.](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/import-and-export-surveys/#ImportingASurvey). For Studies 1 and 2, we will have a sample survey set up and a solution you can compare against. For Study 3, we'll set everything up from scratch.
    
## Workshop objectives:
You will the workshop with some sample code to perform the following functions inside Qualtrics:

1.	Randomize order of stimuli across conditions
2.	Hide the next button for a stipulated time period
3.	Play videos in Qualtrics and set options to autoplay, loop, hide controls
4.	Customize question text 
5.	Learn where to look for solutions to questions you may have

Hopefully at the end of today we are comfortable enough to do more (customize options based on randomized order and previous answer, implement swipe actions for mobile devices) and implement more within-subjects designs in your online panel studies.
